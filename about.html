                <h1>About myself </h1>
                <p>I was born and raised in Miami, Florida, in a family of 8, and I would usually draw or play video games with my friends. Later in my life, we moved to Atlanta, Georgia, for a better education. I had a class for programming games and building robots in high school.
                The projects turned out to be terrible, as expected, but the course made me enjoy coding and the process of building any projects. Sadly in the last year of the class, we were locked in our homes because of covid 19. 
                We couldn’t develop more things because school laptops are fragile to do anything.
                Now I’m a college student currently studying computer programming. </p>

            <div class="right-section-1">
                <h1>My skills</h1>
                <p> My skills currently are programming in c++ and creating front-end web pages. As I grow and learn, I wish to code python, c#, JavaScript, and much more! Eventually, as I’m studying, 
                I want to create video games in many genres.
                I want to be one of if not the best for my family, peers, and myself to look up to. I want to be the best person I can be to maintain my goals for myself and my family. </p>

            </div>

            <div class="right-section-2">
                <h1> My goals !</h1>
                <p> As a computer programming student, I aim to learn how to be the best computer programmer I can be. One day to develop my games or work on projects like dead by daylight from behavior interactive. 
                Also, I want to provide for my family as we have struggled to get to where I am today.
                I want to give my family members a future financial so that they will take you to the top with me. My goals can be Very selfless as I always try to help others and improve my family's lives rather than my own..</p>
